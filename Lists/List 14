//Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array. 
//Note: the built-in min(v1, v2) and max(v1, v2) functions return the smaller or larger of two values.

//big_diff([10, 3, 5, 6]) → 7
//big_diff([7, 2, 10, 9]) → 8
//big_diff([2, 10, 7, 2]) → 8
